## [NativeForms](https://nativeforms.com)

### Build **forms, surveys & polls** for React Native apps.

### Why this product was created?

We created NativeForms to save you countless hours of boring development of forms. Create forms without coding and control them from the [dashboard](https://app.nativeforms.com). Bring all the logic outside your app, so you can control forms even when your app is live.

### Installation

```js
npm install native-forms --save
// or
yarn add native-forms
```

### Basic Usage

1. Import component.

```js
import NativeForms from "native-forms";
```

2. Render form on the screen.

```js
<NativeForms form="https://form.nativeforms.com/I2Z5xWPmZic4JlRvpmNy0Db" />
```

Form is displayed **natively** and **is not a webview**. You can create your own forms [here](https://app.nativeforms.com).

### Modal Example

Basic flow of displaying **NativeForms** as Modal in your application.

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Button, StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";
import { NativeFormsModal } from "native-forms";

const App = () => {
  const [hasForm, showForm] = useState(false);
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Show Form" onPress={() => showForm(true)} color="#20f" />
      <NativeFormsModal
        visible={hasForm}
        form="https://form.nativeforms.com/I2Z5xWPmZic4JlRvpmNy0Db"
        onClose={() => showForm(false)}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: "#fff",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  },
});

export default App;
```

Replace **form prop** with your form's address. You can create your own forms [here](https://app.nativeforms.com).
